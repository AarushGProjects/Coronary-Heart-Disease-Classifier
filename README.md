# Coronary Heart Disease Classifier

The dataset contains risk factors as features that can be used to build predictive models. The task is to compare classification algorithms based on their performance and predict the risk of developing a heart disease. Consider the below mentioned features that are categorized by patient's Demographics, Behavioural and Medical history.

Features:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type (4 values)

Resting blood pressure

Serum cholestoral in mg/dl

Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise induced angina

Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

The slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flouroscopy

Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

Target variable (ordinal):

Class 0: "Not at risk of heart disease" and Class 1: "Risk of heart disease"
